This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Creating New Page

You can run 

```bash
$ ./scripts/make_new_post my-slug
```

and it will create a new post for you. All you would then need to do is modify the
`post.md` file to suit your needs.
