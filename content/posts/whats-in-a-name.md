There are things that _mean_ something to us. So much so that there are entire development processes
centered around getting the names _just right_. Eric Evans' book
[Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG)
spends a great deal of time and energy getting the reader and the organizations that follow their words to define
_things_ as clearly as possible. Eric proports that by _naming_ something the same across the organization, from
the Landing Page all the way down to the implmentation in code, we will somehow come out the otherside with better
understanding and faster velocity.

I am not saying that Eric is _wrong_. I am nowhere near qualified to tell someone as revered as them that. What I
_can_ say is that I _disagree_ with the premise that _if we only named things well_ we could sidestep a large
swath of complexity. 

To really see why, we need to take a step back and ask the impossible question of "What does a word mean?"

### Meaning

Most negative discussions between my partner and I stem from the fact that we use the same words to _express_
different ideas. The easiest example is the word `literally`: it means both `figuratively` and `literally`.
There is no way, without understanding the _context_ in which that word is used, which of the two
_diametrically opposed_ meanings we should apply to our understanding of the person's _intention_.

Taking this even further, how many words do I misunderstand and or misuse? Not just an ambiguous meaning but 
a total misuse of the word. I have been known, more than once, to use _weary_ when I actually meant _wary_ (_thank you 
Josh for pointing that out!_) Using the _context_ of the conversation allows the listener/reader to "know" what I 
"meant".

And it is that _context_ and _meaning_ that I am trying to talk about. Just like in imperative programming,
where we define step by step how to build up the correct state, a conversation is an ongoing, evolving
_context_ where each utterance is a "mutation" to the context and meaning attached to it.

When I spend time with my niblings, they always use some new _slang_ word that is completely and utterly
new to me. They, between themselves, will hold a complete conversation where I assume ideas and thoughts are
exchanged, in a language that _appears_ to be English but fuck if I know _anything_ they are talking about.

I could spend this entire essay discussing how languages change and how we create new words out of old ones,
changing the meaning each generation. However, I fear that will miss the underlying point that I am trying to
make:

> Words are ways to reference _some other thing_, something inside of the _context_ that was built throughout
> the relationship.

Just like the variable `a` doesn't _mean_ what it is assigned to but instead _represents_ it, _words_ do not
_mean_ what we are trying to _represent_ with them.

If they don't _mean_ something but instead _represent_ something, what is that _something_ that we are trying
to represent?
