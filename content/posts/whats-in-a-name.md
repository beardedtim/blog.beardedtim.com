There are things that _mean_ something to us. So much so that there are entire development processes
centered around getting the names _just right_. Eric Evans' book
[Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG)
spends a great deal of time and energy getting the reader and the organizations that follow their words to define
_things_ as clearly as possible. Eric proports that by _naming_ something the same across the organization, from
the Landing Page all the way down to the implmentation in code, we will somehow come out the otherside with better
understanding and faster velocity.

I am not saying that Eric is _wrong_. I am nowhere near qualified to tell someone as revered as them that. What I
_can_ say is that I _disagree_ with the premise that _if we only named things well_ we could sidestep a large
swath of complexity.
