## Step 1: Download Firefox

I do not like Safari at all so let's go download Firefox and sync our devices

## Step 2: Install iTerm

The default terminal for Mac isn't up to my liking. Let's go ahead and install `iTerm`

## Step 3: Install Alfred

The default launcher isn't anything to laugh about but Alfred is pretty great. Let's install it as well

## Step 4: Install Homebrew

Pretty much everything we install with Mac is via Homebrew so let's get that going

## Step 5: Install zsh

zsh > bash

## Step 6: Install oh-my-zsh

We like pretty things

## Step 7: Install Spaceship Prompt

OOOHHH THE COLORS AND SETTINGS!

## Step 8: Install NVM

We are a Node type of person so let's install that as well

## Step 9: Install Docker

Mac makes you download _everything_ at once so we don't need to care about `compose` or `swarm` separately
